# C---Program-to-Draw-a-Pyramid-Shape
 This C++ program draws a pyramid pattern using nested for loops. The user inputs the number of rows, and the program aligns stars (*) to form a centered pyramid shape. The outer loop controls the rows, the first inner loop handles spacing, and the second prints stars, creating a visually symmetric pattern.
